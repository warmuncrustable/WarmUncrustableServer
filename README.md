# Skate 3 Custom Blaze Server
Barebones custom Skate 3 Blaze server for RPCS3 with functional matchmaking. Skate web features such as Import Skaters, Parks, etc. will be implemented eventually too :)

## Setup Guide
Testing locally: Set IP/Hosts switches in Network config to gosredirector.ea.com==127.0.0.1&&downloads.skate.online.ea.com==127.0.0.1

Hosting publicly: Port forward port 42100 for both UDP and TCP, and port 80 for TCP. Lastly set localhost to false in settings.json and launch the server.

Playing with friends via Radmin VPN (Must use Radmin instead of Hamachi): Take your Radmin IP (26.x.x.x), and in the settings.json
on set LocalHost to true and LocalIPAddress to your Radmin IP. Lastly you and your friends must set their IP/Hosts switches in  Network tab to "gosredirector.ea.com==RadminIPhere&&downloads.skate.online.ea.com==RradminIPhere"
